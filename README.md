## Deprecated

This module is deprecated and will be archived on January 17, 2026.
Please see the [pinned issue](https://github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-opsgenie-team/issues/57) for details and migration guidance.

We literally have <a href="https://cpco.io/terraform-modules?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-opsgenie-team&utm_content=terraform_modules">*hundreds of other terraform modules*</a> that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!


### Historical Description

This component provisions Opsgenie teams and related services, rules, and schedules.


> [!TIP]
> #### ðŸ‘½ Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

#### Pre-requisites

You need an API Key stored in `/opsgenie/opsgenie_api_key` of SSM; this is configurable using the
`ssm_parameter_name_format` and `ssm_path` variables.

Opsgenie is now part of Atlassian, so you need to make sure you are creating an Opsgenie API Key, which looks like
`abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef0123456789` and not an Atlassian API key, which looks like:

```shell
ATAfT3xFfGF0VFXAfl8EmQNPVv1Hlazp3wsJgTmM8Ph7iP-RtQyiEfw-fkDS2LvymlyUOOhc5XiSx46vQWnznCJolq-GMX4KzdvOSPhEWr-BF6LEkJQC4CSjDJv0N7d91-0gVekNmCD2kXY9haUHUSpO4H7X6QxyImUb9VmOKIWTbQi8rf4CF28=63CB21B9
```

Generate an API Key by going to Settings -> API key management on your Opsgenie control panel, which will have an
address like `https://<your-org>.app.opsgenie.com/settings/api-key-management`, and click the "Add new API key" button.

Once you have the key, test it with curl to verify that you are at least on a Standard plan with OpsGenie:

```
curl -X GET 'https://api.opsgenie.com/v2/account' \
    --header "Authorization: GenieKey $API_KEY"
```

The result should be something similar to below:

```
{
    "data": {
        "name": "opsgenie",
        "plan": {
            "maxUserCount": 1500,
            "name": "Enterprise",
    ...
}
```

If you see `Free` or `Essentials` in the plan, then you won't be able to use this component.

#### Getting Started

- Stack Level: Global

This component should only be applied once as the resources it creates are regional, but it works with integrations.
This is typically done via the auto or corp stack (e.g. `gbl-auto.yaml`).

```yaml
# 9-5 Mon-Fri
business_hours: &business_hours
  type: "weekday-and-time-of-day"
  restrictions:
    - start_hour: 9
      start_min: 00
      start_day: "monday"
      end_hour: 17
      end_min: 00
      end_day: "friday"

# 9-5 Every Day
waking_hours: &waking_hours
  type: "time-of-day"
  restrictions:
    - start_hour: 9
      start_min: 00
      end_hour: 17
      end_min: 00

# This is a partial incident mapping, we use this as a base to add P1 & P2 below. This is not a complete mapping as there is no P0
priority_level_to_incident: &priority_level_to_incident
  enabled: true
  type: incident
  priority: P1
  order: 1
  notify: # if omitted, this will default to the default schedule
    type: schedule

    conditions:

        operation: equals

p1: &p1_is_incident
  <<: *priority_level_to_incident
  priority: P1
  criteria:
    type: "match-all-conditions"
    conditions:
      - field: priority
        operation: equals
        expected_value: P1

p2: &p2_is_incident
  <<: *priority_level_to_incident
  priority: P2
  criteria:

    conditions:
      - field: priority

              type: schedule # could be escalation, could be none

          # Since Incidents require a service, we create a rule for every `routing_rule` type `incident` for every service on the team.
          # This is done behind the scenes by the `opsgenie-team` component.
          # These rules below map P1 & P2 to incidents, using yaml anchors from above.
          p1: *p1_is_incident
          p2: *p2_is_incident

              notify_type: default
              delay: 30
              recipients:
                - type: schedule
                  name: secondary_on_call
```

The API keys relating to the Opsgenie Integrations are stored in SSM Parameter Store and can be accessed via chamber.

```
AWS_PROFILE=foo chamber list opsgenie-team/<team>
```

### ClickOps Work

- After deploying the opsgenie-team component the created team will have a schedule named after the team. This is
  purposely left to be clickOpsâ€™d so the UI can be used to set who is on call, as that is the usual way (not through
  code). Additionally, we do not want a re-apply of the Terraform to delete or shuffle who is planned to be on call,
  thus we left who is on-call on a schedule out of the component.

### Known Issues

#### Different API Endpoints in Use

The problem is there are 3 different api endpoints in use

- `/webapp` - the most robust - only exposed to the UI (that we've seen)
- `/v2/` - robust with some differences from `webapp`
- `/v1/` - the oldest and furthest from the live UI.

#### Cannot create users

This module does not create users. Users must have already been created to be added to a team.

#### Cannot Add dependent Services

- Api Currently doesn't support Multiple ServiceIds for incident Rules

#### Cannot Add Stakeholders

- Track the issue: https://github.com/opsgenie/terraform-provider-opsgenie/issues/278

#### No Resource to create Slack Integration

- Track the issue: https://github.com/DataDog/terraform-provider-datadog/issues/67

#### Out of Date Terraform Docs

Another Problem is the terraform docs are not always up to date with the provider code.

The OpsGenie Provider uses a mix of `/v1` and `/v2`. This means there are many things you can only do from the UI.

Listed below in no particular order

- Incident Routing cannot add dependent services - in `v1` and `v2` a `service_incident_rule` object has `serviceId` as
  type string, in webapp this becomes `serviceIds` of type `list(string)`
- Opsgenie Provider appears to be inconsistent with how it uses `time_restriction`:
  - `restrictions` for type `weekday-and-time-of-day`
  - `restriction` for type `time-of-day`

Unfortunately none of this is in the terraform docs, and was found via errors and digging through source code.

Track the issue: https://github.com/opsgenie/terraform-provider-opsgenie/issues/282

#### GMT Style Timezones

We recommend to use the human readable timezone such as `Europe/London`.

- Setting a schedule to a GMT-style timezone with offsets can cause inconsistent plans.

  Setting the timezone to `Etc/GMT+1` instead of `Europe/London`, will lead to permadrift as OpsGenie converts the GMT
  offsets to regional timezones at deploy-time. In the previous deploy, the GMT style get converted to
  `Atlantic/Cape_Verde`.

  ```hcl
  # module.routing["london_schedule"].module.team_routing_rule[0].opsgenie_team_routing_rule.this[0] will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "opsgenie_team_routing_rule" "this" {
          id         = "4b4c4454-8ccf-41a9-b856-02bec6419ba7"
          name       = "london_schedule"
      ~ timezone   = "Atlantic/Cape_Verde" -> "Etc/GMT+1"
          # (2 unchanged attributes hidden)
  ```

  Some GMT styles will not cause a timezone change on subsequent applies such as `Etc/GMT+8` for `Asia/Taipei`.

- If the calendar date has crossed daylight savings time, the `Etc/GMT+` GMT style will need to be updated to reflect
  the correct timezone.
